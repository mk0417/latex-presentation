# Minimalist LaTeX Template for Academic Presentations

This repository contains a [LaTeX](https://github.com/latex3/latex2e) template to create an academic presentation. The template uses the [Beamer class](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer). The template follows typographical best practices and has a minimalist design. The template is particularly well suited for research presentations. It is designed to convey scientific arguments and results effectively.

## Documentation

The template is documented at https://pascalmichaillat.org/c/.

## Illustration

The presentation produced by the template can be viewed at https://pascalmichaillat.org/c.pdf.

## Usage

+ Clone the repository to your local machine.
+ Start editing the LaTeX file `presentation.tex` to replace the boilerplate content with the content of your presentation. 
+ Replace the figures in the PDF file `figures.pdf` with the figures that will be included in the presentation (one figure per page).
+ Compile `presentation.tex` with pdfTeX. This will generate a new PDF file named `presentation.pdf`.
+ The LaTeX style file `presentation.sty` formats the presentation. It must be included in the same folder as `presentation.tex`. It can be modified to alter the presentation's format.
+ The file `presentation.pdf` is not required to use the template. It only illustrates the output of the template. It will be overwritten when `presentation.tex` is compiled.

## Software

+ The template was developed with TeX Live 2023 on macOS. 
+ Other LaTeX distributions and operating systems may require minor adjustments. Please [report any issues](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math/issues) to help improve compatibility.
